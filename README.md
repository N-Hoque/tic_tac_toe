# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is an implementation of the schoolyard game using only bit patterns, built in Rust.

## How to Build

1. Clone this repository
2. `cargo run --release`
3. (Optional) If you want documentation on what the code does: `cargo doc --document-private-items --open`
4. (Optional) If you want to run the tests: `cargo test`

## How to Play

Select a cell by pressing a number from 1-9.
Cells are represented left-to-right, top-to-bottom, so:

- 1-3 is the top row,
- 4-6 is the centre row
- 7-9 is the bottom row.
